Itâ€™s Deschutes Breweryâ€™s GF NW Pale Ale. This beer gets crafty with its use of Nugget, Crystal, Bravo and Galaxy hops, and its sweet blend of Belgian candi syrup. You would hardly know that this gluten free beer is fermented with rice instead of barley. Brewed especially for those who could use a little less gluten in their lives. Go on, try it!", done: false},

This unfiltered brew's temperature-programmed mash using atmospheric boil with steam combines with the use of hopback hops to provide a double impact of powerful citrus notes that complement complex fruity yeast esters. This beer has an aggressive bitterness that will Van Dammage your palate; Jean Claude would be proud.", done: false},

Magnum hops for bittering and Mt. Hoods for flavoring and at knockout add a bit of hop spicness and complexity, but not so much as to hide the special ingredients.", done: false},

A \"living beer,\" it is dosed with yeast and naturally carbonated. A witbier bursting with good karma, Namaste was originally brewed at the Rehoboth Beach pub with Leo from Birra del Borgo as a tribute to Dogfish's friends at 3 Fonteinen brewery in Belgium, which had a devastating production loss (1/3 of their annual production) in 2009.", done: false},

You, we imagine, and not a whole lot else. Serious poundage of Gambrinus pilsner and honey malts plus immeasurable amounts of Cluster hops create this fermentation giant, and the brewery's in-house Abbey strain of yeast does the heavy lifting to create a 7.3% alcohol beast that looks as light as a session ale - and drinks just as easy.", done: false},

One of the few lagers here today, it may be the only beer in the festival using French hops (Aramis) which, added to the hopback, provide a delicate, herbal German Noble hop type aroma with a hint of lemon.

Hemp seed creates a subtle nutty flavor that complements the hops and barley. The unique protein spectrum of the hemp seeds gives this beer a rich, creamy head and imparts mellow herbal flavors and aromas. The spice notes of the barley and hemp blend seamlessly into the citrus hops, creating an interesting beer that's easy to drink on a sweaty day, but worth sipping whenever you have the time.", done: false},

Most beers this dark are so heavy-duty, you could eat them with a fork. Session Black, on the other hand, lets you have your dark beer and drink it, too.

American hops take front stage with Simcoe, Amarillo and Citra collaborating on a five tier assault. Hop additions started with first wort, hop bursting, four kettle hop introductions, and a long, patient dry-hop with three separate additions. Then to climax on the day before being kegged, the brewers run the finished beer over whole Citra hops, stripping lupulin and creating even more aroma.

It features pilsner, Vienna and Munich malts, is bittered with Nelson Sauvin and Citra hops, and finished with locally raised lemongrass from West Maui Farms.

Think IPA with the smoothness of a summer pilsner. Superior pilsen, flaked barley, and light crystal malts create the golden malt base. Chinook and Centennial provide both bitterness and intense flavor, backed up by late additions of Simcoe and more Centennial in the hop back. After fermentation, it's lagered for several weeks, with dry-hopping in the brite tank. Taste why it won top honors at the McMenamins Hillsdale Brewfest!", done: false},

Shasta Brewing Co","Style": "Strawberry & Ginger Hefeweizen","Beer": "Skip and Go Naked","tap_trailer": 6,"IBU": 13,"ABV": 4.8,"Notes": "This beer is dry-hopped ... without hops! Instead it contains 20 pounds of sundried California strawberries and eight pounds of fresh ginger. To make sure you can taste those unique ingredients, a modest amount of the delicate Liberty hops are used to balance the grain bill of Gambrinus ESB, organic wheat and extra special malt. This brew will make you want to Skip N Go Naked. Buy one for the most attractive person you see at the festival.", done: false},

Hallertau hops do moderate bittering, joined by Czech Saaz for flavoring with even more Saaz tossed into the whirlpool for that spicy, delicate aroma. Fermented and lagered for eight weeks for maximum smoothness.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "North Coast Brewing Co","Style": "Belgian Style Golden Ale","Beer": "PranQster","tap_trailer": 4,"IBU": 20,"ABV": 7.6,"Notes": "This beer's amazing flavor is primarily yeast driven, a mixed culture of antique yeast strains that produce a floral, slight banana nose, a fruity flavor and a clean finish. Noble Tettnanger hops provide just enough bitterness to balance the big malt base, with finishing hops courtesty of Mt. Hoods. The beer's golden color and low bitterness may deceive you into thinking it's a session beer, but this beer is big in both flavor and alcohol.", done: false},

It uses 26 ingredients, many sourced in Oregon, and features a very approachable 26 IBUs. Two kinds of locally sourced honey and a host of spices, herbs and citrus peels are layered on the Oregon grown malt and hops to make a very unique, yet light and refreshing local golden ale.", done: false},

Occidental's is characteristically refreshing with a moderate maltiness and smooth bitterness thanks to multiple additions of German Tettnanger hops.", done: false},

Wonderfully hoppy aromas come first from the Columbus, Cascade, Warrior and Kent Goldings in the boil and Centennials for dry-hopping. Then comes a rich, slightly fruity mouthfeel delivered by pale, crystal, wheat and two-row malts. The refreshingly dry finish is marked by a sophisticated hop bitterness. At 85 IBUs, this big beer is not for the timid.", done: false},

Raspberries, blackberries, black currants and boysenberries add tart, fruity depth to the pilsner, wheat, flaked wheat, Vienna, Munich, flaked oats and acidulated malt. Spontaneous fermentation and barrel aging create a Lactobacillus-soured wort and an amazingly dry finish for a very big beer. Modest amounts of Willamette hops keep the bitterness to a minimum.", done: false},

Pils, Vienna, carafoam and aromatic malts fermented with German lager yeast make this Dortmunder-style ale malty and clean on the palate. Its full malt character and strong noble hop profile from Golden, Sterling, Liberty and Santiams strike a Prussian balance during its seven week lager time.", done: false},

The heavy-handed use of Cascade and Summit hops give it notable pine, citrus and grapefruit aromas and flavors. The bitterness is what you would expect of a NW IPA but this beer is balanced and smooth due to the perfect level of malt sweetness. The finish is crisp, clean and refreshing: a true IPA loverâ€™s IPA, and gluten-free to boot!", done: false},

Gâ€™Knight sports a surprisingly sensuous finish for a beer of its size. Itâ€™s brewed in tribute to a fellow Colorado craft beer pioneer and Vietnam vet who died fighting a 2002 wildfire outside of the brewery's hometown of Lyons. For all the details behind this tribute, visit www.N3978Y.com. Gâ€™Morninâ€™. Gâ€™Day. Gâ€™Knight.", done: false},

His favorite? The Pokerface Blonde. Pale, Crystal, Carapils and Vienna malts provide the beer's blonde hue. Her pokerface is attributed to the calcium sulfate and calcium chlorides added to her 10,000 year old water.", done: false},

Czech Saaz and other imported hops (we ain't tellin') do the bittering and add hop flavor and spicy aromas. The high-gravity wort is fermented dry to leave a big, unsuspecting alcohol kick.", done: false},

Kind of like The Fonz without the goofy sidekicks. Biere de Garde means \"beer to keep,\" and you'll want to guard your glass once you get this one - and then beat a hasty retreat back into line for more. Surrender to flavor!", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "Rogue Ales","Style": "Belgian-Golden","Beer": "Beard Beer","tap_trailer": 10,"IBU": 25,"ABV": 5.6,"Notes": "Rogue brewer John\"More Hops\" Maier has had the same Old Growth Beard since 1983 and for more than 15,000 brews, so it is no great surprise that a natural yeast ideal for brewing was discovered in his beard... and yes, used in this beer. No need to freak out â€“ brewers have used wild yeasts in beer making for centuries. This light-colored ale is deceptively strong with a solid hop backbone that lets you know you're drinking a Rogue.", done: false},

It's a single-hop beer, with Willamettes doing all of the bittering, flavoring and aroma duties. All those ingredients work hard to flavor Portland's pure Bull Run water. You'll be able to enjoy a few of these mild brews, low in alcohol by festival standards.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "Seven Brides Brewing","Style": "IPA","Beer": "Frankenlou's IPA","tap_trailer": 2,"IBU": 105,"ABV": 7,"Notes": "At 105 IBU, this American IPA is the hop monster of the festival. Two doses of the high alpha acid Nugget hops - one for bittering, the other at knockout for flavor â€“ are sandwiched around mid-brew doses of citrusy Columbus and Cascade. Abiqua Basinâ€™s finest water joins two-row pale, crystal, Munich and carastan malts in the mash.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "Silver Moon Brewing","Style": "Imperial Red Ale","Beer": "Bone Crusher Imperial Red","tap_trailer": 1,"IBU": 100,"ABV": 8.6,"Notes": "This big red ale gets its sweet backbone, caramel flavors and blood red color from generous portions of American crystal and midnight wheat malts. Bold and assertive high alpha hops (Simcoe, Summit, Columbus and Chinook) provide a resinous bitterness and an aggressive citrusy-piney-floral finish. Bone Crusher is an intensely flavored strong ale with a medium body that results in a beer that's robust, balanced and hoppy.", done: false},

Columbus hops do the bittering, while the relatively new hop El Dorado combines with Calypso in the whirlpool for finishing and into the fermenter to dry-hop this balanced brew. Clean California ale yeast provides a crisp finish.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "Stone Brewing Co","Style": "American IPA","Beer": "Stone Delicious IPA","tap_trailer": 9,"IBU": 116,"ABV": 8.3,"Notes": "This bright and deep gold IPA is brewed with six great hops thrown into the mix, including the addition of two new hops (Mosaic and El Dorado) that Stone has never used before. Itâ€™s full bodied, dry and very bitter, with flavors of spiced bread, grapefruit, lemon, nectarine and pine.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "Surly Brewing Co","Style": "American IPA","Beer": "OverRated! West Coast IPA","tap_trailer": 2,"IBU": 73,"ABV": 7.3,"Notes": "Don't know what beer to get? Don't just stand there, get Surly and watch the elbows. Two-row pale and Belgian malts are balanced by El Dorado, Centennial and Chinook hops and accentuated by the hard brewing water. An English ale yeast leaves a lightly fruity flavor and aroma. See for yourself if it's really OverRated!", done: false, favorites: true, als_pics: true},
                {"Brewery": "Terminal Gravity Brewing","Style": "Craft Malt Liquor","Beer": "Tap Out","tap_trailer": 7,"IBU": 80,"ABV": 10,"Notes": "This highly quaffable beer also carries a punch. Northwest pale, Vienna and Munich malts, as well as some flaked rye, provide the malty sweetness of this high-gravity ale that's fermented by a private strain of British ale yeast. Halletau Mittlefrue, French Strisselspalt, Crystal and Columbus hops balance all that malt. The result is a beer with some alcohol sweetness and a lot of subtle estery flavors with a long finish.", done: false},

The Dudes' traveled from Los Angeles for their first trip to the OBF, and they decided to bring Grandma along. This English-style brown ale features a nice rich body courtesy of toasted Georgia pecans added in the mash.", done: false},

This beer's unique ingredient is 100% natural Key lime juice. Two-row, crystal and wheat malts formulate the malty base and provide a light golden color. Saaz and Mt. Hood hops provide just enough bitterness to balance. Fermentation with a private yeast strain yields clean, crisp flavor characteristics with low fruitiness and mild ester production.", done: false},
                {"Brewery": "West Highland Brewing","Style": "Fruit Beer","Beer": "Mango Moon Ale","tap_trailer": 6,"IBU": 18,"ABV": 6.6,"Notes": "Mango flavor is introduced into this beer by the way of a proprietary process. You'll have to visit West Highland's secret Vancouver brewing facility to find out what it is... maybe. Premium two-row malted barley provides sweet wort fermented by a special blend of English pale ale yeasts designed for malty, sweet beers. You guessed it, that's secret too. We'll tell you this much: the hops are Fuggles, Fuggles and more Fuggles.", done: false},

Pilsner and Munich malts create a golden wort, hopped entirely with Hallertau noble hops for a delicate balancing bitterness, flavor and aroma. Clean lager yeast ferments out crisply so you can taste the spices. Thai one on!", done: false},

Two-row pale and Munich malts provide an authentic Munich-style grain bill, and the brewers keep the German theme going with a Munich lager yeast - and, of course, plenty of cold lagering for extra smoothness.", done: false},

The honey supplements the fermentables provided by two-row pale, crystal, Vienna and Munich malts. The earthy noble Golding hops do the bittering, assisted by the heather tips.
